# bluebed
A simple download interface to the deepblue API (http://deepblue.mpi-inf.mpg.de)


## TODO
1. Add better filtering per project (encode, roadmap, deep) and warn when downloading from projects without filters.
2. Understand what experiments that are simple different analysis stages of the same FASTQ file from the same source.
   1. Have sane defaults
   2. Allow choice
